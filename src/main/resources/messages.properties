tip.1=Look at the spring-context.xml file and see if you understand what happens.
tip.2=Figure out how spring is wired into the application.
tip.3=How do you access Session parameters in an ftl file? And Request parameters?
tip.4=Try to inject a property from the application.properties file into your AppController
tip.5=Create a new page with a form on it and post the data. Present the posted data on a new page
tip.6=Create validators for the former tip (make your own rules) and add the validation to the form. When wrong present the errors on the form-page otherwise go to the new page as before.
tip.7=These tips have been put in the messages*.properties files (see source). How do you get the "other" language? Where is decided what language is used? And how is it possible for spring to access these messages?
tip.8=How does the injection of a view object in a RequestMapping work?
tip.9=See if you can get the "catch-all" exception page?
